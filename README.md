# The Official Memorandum Maker

***

A ReactJS based static website that generates Official Memorandums in accordance with AFH 33-337. 

**All calculations are downloaded to your PC and no information is sent to any servers. The only information that will leave over a network is the unit seal which is only sent to your own local machine in order to convert it from an image into Base64 code.**

***

##### To Be Done 

* Add seals of different units/upload your own

* Change from Department of the Air Force to any department

* Export a 'Default' confit that you can save and use to reiterate your own information instead of having to type it in every time

* Ability to do bullet points

* Export as a Microsoft Word Document (.doc(x))

* Mobile Device Compatibility

* Multi-line ATTN/FROM sections



##### Current Issues

* Formatting of the navigation bar on mobile devices

* Generation of PDF's on mobile devices causes issues with the aspect ratio and stretches out the PDF
